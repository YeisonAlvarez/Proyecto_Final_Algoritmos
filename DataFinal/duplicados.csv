However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’.

Jeffrey Huang and Simon Elias Bibri and Paul Keel;Generative spatial artificial intelligence for sustainable smart cities: A pioneering large flow model for urban digital twin;2025;24;Desconocido;100526;Desconocido;Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ese.2025.100526;"Sustainable smart cities; Generative artificial intelligence; Generative spatial artificial intelligence; Foundation models; Large flow model; Urban digital twin; Urban planning and design";Environmental Science and Ecotechnology;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666498425000043;ScienceDirect;generative spatial artificial intelligence for sustainable smart cities: a pioneering large flow model for urban digital twin

The aim of this study is to examine nursing students' attitudes toward AI use, their patterns of use and levels of AI addiction, as well as to evaluate the impact of emerging fears such as AIlessphobia.
Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving and is increasingly being used among university students. Concepts such as “AIlessphobia” -the fear of being without AI- highlight the emergence of these issues.
Design
This study used a mixed-methods design.
Methods
The study was carried out during the 2024–2025 Spring Semester with nursing students. Data were collected using the Scale for Dependence on Artificial Intelligence (DAI) and semi-structured interview questions. Qualitative interviews were conducted with students who scored 15 or higher on DAI. The quantitative sample consists of 200 students and the qualitative sample was determined based on quantitative and qualitative data.
Results
Most participants (81.5 %) reported using AI tools, with ChatGPT being the most preferred among them. The interview included 13 questions and the themes emerged during the individual interviews. Thematic analysis highlighted five themes: educational benefits, negative effects, AI addiction, future expectations and AIlessphobia. Students noted that AI eased learning but reduced critical thinking and reported emotional distress when deprived of AI access.
Conclusions
The widespread use of AI tools in education produces both positive and negative effects. It is essential for educators to support students in integrating these tools with critical thinking skills and digital awareness.

B. Bouvarel and N. Lapidus;CO11.1 - Causal inference by generation of synthetic data from electronic health records as an alternative to inverse probability of treatment weighting: a simulation study;2025;73;Desconocido;203024;Desconocido;"Background and objective(s)
Causal inference from observational studies is increasingly considered to evaluate treatment effects when randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are impractical, as it addresses confounding biases inherent in non-randomized data. Methods such as inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) are widely employed to mitigate these biases. However, IPTW often faces challenges, including issues with extreme weights, sensitivity to unmeasured confounding, and large sample size requirements. Recent advances in neural networks have demonstrated the potential to generate realistic synthetic data that replicate the statistical properties of real-world data. These advances may enhance traditional causal inference methods by creating counterfactual populations. However, the use of synthetic data in causal inference remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the adequacy of synthetic data generation for creating counterfactual populations and to compare its performance with IPTW. This approach was applied to evaluate the effect of early prone position on 28-day mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.
Material and Methods
We conducted a simulation study with 2,000 observations, considering a treatment and a binary outcome influenced by confounding factors. Three methods were used to generate datasets of 50,000 synthetic observations: Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), Realistic Relational and Tabular Data using Transformers (REaLTabFormer), and simpler regression models. Observations with similar propensity scores were sampled from the synthetic dataset to create counterfactual populations, with sample sizes corresponding to inverse probability of treatment weights. The treatment effect was estimated using univariable logistic regression and compared to the true simulated effect. These methods were applied to electronic health records (EHRs) from the “Assistance publique–Hôpitaux de Paris” data warehouse, focusing on COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation within 48 hours of admission.
Results
Both REaLTabFormer and regression methods achieved performance broadly similar to that obtained using only the original data with IPTW. CTGAN exhibited higher biases, larger standard errors, and higher type I and type II error rates. The application of these methods to real-world EHR data from mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients demonstrated the high quality of data generated by the models, with joint distributions of variables closely mimicking those of the original datasets. None of the evaluated methods identified an effect of early prone position on 28-day mortality.
Conclusion
This study highlights the potential of synthetic data generation for creating counterfactual populations, thereby addressing some of the limitations of IPTW. While the evaluated frameworks provided estimates that were at best similar to IPTW, further research is needed in scenarios where IPTW may encounter more limitations, such as small sample sizes or larger numbers of confounding factors. These findings underline both the promise and the challenges of integrating synthetic data into causal inference methods.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeph.2025.203024;"Causality; Observational Studies; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Electronic Health Records";Journal of Epidemiology and Population Health;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950433325002186;ScienceDirect;co11.1 - causal inference by generation of synthetic data from electronic health records as an alternative to inverse probability of treatment weighting: a simulation study

Abel;Feasibility of Utilizing a Virtual Health Assistant during Inpatient Reduced-Intensity Allogeneic Transplantation;2024;30;2, Supplement ;S123;S124;"Background
Patients undergoing inpatient allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) often experience psychological consequences. care.coach AvatarTM is a tablet-based ‘human-in-the-loop’ virtual health assistant (VHA) that uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) to provide psychosocial support. It has improved loneliness, depression, anxiety, hospital delirium, and falls in older adults in the hospital (Bott, J Med Internet Res 2019).
Methods
We adapted the care.coach AvatarTM VHA for inpatient HCT. The VHA engages patients with reminders for hydration, medications, food, or activity; HCT education modules; playing games; playing the news or music; having free-form conversations; going through therapeutic activities and exercises; and practicing mindfulness and guided meditation. Avatar protocols were updated based on feedback from a structured focus group (n=10) of nurse navigators, inpatient HCT nurses, and HCT physicians at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. 7 HCT-specific educational modules were created. A feasibility pilot was performed in 3 sequential cohorts of 6 patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT. In the first cohort, patients were given the VHAs without any recommendations for how long to use them. The second cohort was given a recommendation for 30 minutes per day, and the third cohort was offered a $20 gift card for completion of at least 4 modules. Responses were measured through patient surveys and engagement data analysis. Predefined retention rate for feasibility was 67%, a standard for introduction of a novel AI technology (Teresi, Med Care 2022). Dissatisfaction rate for the overall VHA experience was defined as responding “disagree” or “strongly disagree” with recommending the VHA to others.
Results
The study included 18 patients (Table). Retention rate from enrollment to discharge or three weeks (whichever came first) was 78% (95% CI: 52-94%). A post-pilot survey was completed by 16 patients (90%), revealing a dissatisfaction rate of 28%. Dissatisfaction rates decreased from 50% to 20% to 0% across the 3 cohorts. Frequency of completion of the post-pilot survey for the full study was 72% within 1 week of disenrollment, and 90% overall. Average completion rate was 52% for all seven HCT modules in the whole study population. Across cohorts, module completion rates changed from 5% to 88% to 62%, reflecting guidance to patients. VHA functions by most time of usage were music (35%), exercise (20%), and education (15%; Figure).
Conclusions
The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the care.coach AvatarTM VHA for inpatient HCT patients. Despite modest dissatisfaction and variability in completion rates, the VHA showed promise in providing HCT education, social, and emotional support for inpatient RIC HCT.

Mohammad Amin Roshani and Xiangyu Zhou and Yao Qiang and Srinivasan Suresh and Steven Hicks and Usha Sethuraman and Dongxiao Zhu;Generative Large Language Model—Powered Conversational AI App for Personalized Risk Assessment: Case Study in COVID-19;2025;4;Desconocido;Desconocido;Desconocido;"Background
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment. Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding, limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments. This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming.
Objective
This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data.
Methods
We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability.
Results
Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results.
Conclusions
Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support.";https://doi.org/10.2196/67363;"personalized risk assessment; large language model; conversational AI; artificial intelligence; COVID-19";JMIR AI;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2817170525000213;ScienceDirect;generative large language model—powered conversational ai app for personalized risk assessment: case study in covid-19

Mohammad Amin Roshani and Xiangyu Zhou and Yao Qiang and Srinivasan Suresh and Steven Hicks and Usha Sethuraman and Dongxiao Zhu;Generative Large Language Model—Powered Conversational AI App for Personalized Risk Assessment: Case Study in COVID-19;2025;4;Desconocido;Desconocido;Desconocido;"Background
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment. Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding, limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments. This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming.
Objective
This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data.
Methods
We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability.
Results
Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results.
Conclusions
Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support.";https://doi.org/10.2196/67363;"personalized risk assessment; large language model; conversational AI; artificial intelligence; COVID-19";JMIR AI;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2817170525000213;ScienceDirect;generative large language model—powered conversational ai app for personalized risk assessment: case study in covid-19

In addition to standard older adult care services, mobile medical devices have proved to be an effective tool for controlling the health of older adults. However, little is known about the variables driving the acceptance of these gadgets and the willingness of older adults in China to use them.
Objective
This study aims to explore the factors that affect the use of mobile health (mHealth) devices by older adults in China, focusing on individual, social, and family influences.
Methods
The Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents survey database provided the data for this study. The survey was conducted in 148 Chinese cities between June 20 and August 31, 2022. The parameters linked to older persons’ desire to use mobile medical devices were determined by this study using a combination model of multiple stepwise linear regression and a classification and regression tree decision tree.
Results
In total, 4085 older adults took part in the poll. On a scale of 0 to 100, the average score for willingness to adopt mHealth devices was 63.70 (SD 25.11). The results of the multiple stepwise linear regression showed that having a postgraduate degree and higher (β=.040; P=.007), being unemployed (β=.037; P=.02), having a high social status (β=.085; P<.001), possessing high health literacy (β=.089; P<.001), demonstrating high self-efficacy (β=.043; P=.02), not living with children (β=.0340; P=.02), having a household per capita monthly income of >Y4000 (US $550) (β=.048; P=.002), experiencing high perceived social support (β=.096; P<.001), reporting a high quality of life (β=.149; P<.001), having higher levels of family communication (β=–.071; P<.001), having an identity bubble (β=.085; P<.001), not having chronic diseases (β=.049; P=.001), and experiencing mild depression (β=–.035; P=.02) were associated with older adults’ willingness to use mHealth devices. The classification and regression tree decision tree model’s findings demonstrated that the primary determinants of older adults’ desire to use mHealth devices are quality of life, identity bubble, social status, health literacy, family health, and perceived social support.
Conclusions

Aimery Sabelle and Julien Berhouet and Adrien Lemaignen and Louis-Romée {Le Nail} and Ramy Samargandi;Results of the Girdlestone Procedure for the Treatment of Refractory Hip Prosthesis Infections;2025;Desconocido;Desconocido;104313;Desconocido;"Introduction
Refractory prosthetic joint infections (PJI) of the hip remain a major challenge in orthopedic surgery. The Girdlestone procedure, also known as resection arthroplasty, was originally described for native hips but has since been adopted as a salvage option for complex and recurrent prosthetic infections. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in treating prosthetic hip infections in this context.
Materials and methods
Eighty-eight patients (91 hips) who underwent femoral resection arthroplasty for refractory hip prosthesis infection between March 2004 and August 2019 were retrospectively included and analyzed as part of a single-center study with a minimum follow-up of two years. The primary outcome was infection eradication. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of treatment failure and the nature of postoperative complications. Risk factors for failure were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. Bacteriological data and functional outcomes were also reported.
Results
Out of 91 hips, infection eradication was achieved in 65 cases (71%) following Girdlestone procedure. Six postoperative deaths related to infection occurred (6/88, 7%). In 20 out of 91 hips (22%), one or more revision surgeries were performed for persistent infection after implant removal. Among these, infection control was achieved in 10/20 (50%). Multivariate analysis identified corticosteroid use (HR = 6; p < 0.01), preoperative fever (HR = 4.12; p < 0.01), and polymicrobial infection (HR = 2.5; p < 0.05) as independent risk factors for failure. The mean limb shortening was 5.7 (±1.7) cm, and the average walking distance was 175 (±350) meters. The mean Merle d’Aubigné and Postel score at final follow-up was 9.3 (±2.2) out of 18.
Conclusion
Definitive removal of the hip prosthesis remains a viable therapeutic option in refractory infections, despite a substantial complication rate. It should be considered, particularly when the prosthesis is no longer functional.

In technological advancement, fostering students’ creativity is particularly crucial. This study examines how creative growth mindsets, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) self-efficacy, creative environments, ICT availability, and ICT information practices influence creative self-efficacy (CSE) and creative thinking. The study conducted path analyses on 16,148 secondary school students in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, China in PISA 2022. The results showed that growth mindsets, ICT self-efficacy, and creative environments can directly promote their creative self-efficacy and thinking, while school environments negatively impact creative thinking. Besides, online information practices mediate the relationship between predictors, CSE, and creative thinking. However, ICT feedback and support do not serve as mediators for creative thinking. ICT availability at school positively affects CSE through ICT feedback, while ICT availability outside of school has a negative effect. This study highlights the combined influence of individual traits, behaviors, and external environments on students’ creative thinking, providing valuable insights for educators to take a holistic approach to fostering student development.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2025.102631;"Creative thinking; Creative self-efficacy; Creative environments; ICT self-efficacy; ICT information practices; PISA 2022";International Journal of Educational Research;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035525001053;ScienceDirect;the role of growth mindset, self-efficacy, and environmental support in ict practices for creative thinking development

Through two studies utilizing the Triarchic psychopathy model in undergraduate samples, significant psychopathy impairment was identified. Broadly, disinhibition was related to the most significant impairments across functioning domains. Boldness was more variable and elicited both positive (e.g., higher quality of life, lower self-harm) and negative (impairments in empathy and intimacy) outcomes. Meanness was primarily related to interpersonal difficulties; however, differences in measuring meanness led to different findings on its connection to personality functioning.

A retrospective real-world cohort study;2025;Desconocido;Desconocido;100030;Desconocido;"Background
Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Given its rarity, clinical management often mirrors colorectal cancer dCRC), despite distinct molecular features and inferior outcomes. Although checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy has shown efficacy in mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) CRC, data in SBA remain scarce, and MMR testing is not routinely implemented.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of SBA patients treated with CPI at Copenhagen University Hospital – Herlev between March 2019 and January 2024. Radiological responses were assessed using RECIST v1.1. We also analyzed the frequency of MMR testing and dMMR status in SBA patients.
Results
Among 148 SBA patients, seven received CPI therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) was 86%, with one (14%) complete response (CR) and five (71%) partial responses (PR). Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 31 months (mFU:32 months); median overall survival (mOS) was not reached (mFU: 33 months). Overall, 55% underwent MMR testing, and 18% of SBA patients were dMMR.
Conclusion
CPI therapy yields high, durable response rates in dMMR SBA, supporting dMMR as a predictive biomarker. However, inconsistent MMR testing strategy may limit access to optimal treatment.

The purpose of our study was to develop a novel magnetic resonance imaging classification system to predict the progression of traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (TONFH) in young adults and assess its clinical implications.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2007 to December 2022, including 134 hips (134 patients, mean age 41 years (range, 21 to 43), 65.7% men) diagnosed with TONFH at Association Research Circulation Osseous Stage I. The bone repair band (BRB) classification system categorized lesions into Superficial (Type S), Uncertain (Type U), and Extensive (Type E) based on magnetic resonance imaging coronal views. Patients were followed with observational treatment and x-ray assessments. Radiographic signs and femoral head collapse were evaluated during follow-up. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between BRB classification and disease progression.
Results
The 134 hips were categorized into Type S (n = 54), Type U (n = 21), and Type E (n = 59). Over a mean follow-up of 39.6 months, radiographic signs were most prevalent in Type E (94.9%) and least in Type S (9.3%), with median times to radiographic signs of 18 months for Type U and 16 months for Type E. Femoral head collapse occurred in 50.8% of Type E, 23.8% of Type U, and none in Type S, with a median time to collapse of 34 months for Type E. Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified BRB classification as an independent predictor of disease progression, with Type E showing the highest risk for adverse outcomes.
Conclusions
The newly proposed BRB classification provides a systematic approach to assessing necrotic lesion severity in TONFH and demonstrates significant correlation with femoral head collapse risk.

The parameters linked to older persons’ desire to use mobile medical devices were determined by this study using a combination model of multiple stepwise linear regression and a classification and regression tree decision tree.
Results
In total, 4085 older adults took part in the poll. On a scale of 0 to 100, the average score for willingness to adopt mHealth devices was 63.70 (SD 25.11). The results of the multiple stepwise linear regression showed that having a postgraduate degree and higher (β=.040; P=.007), being unemployed (β=.037; P=.02), having a high social status (β=.085; P<.001), possessing high health literacy (β=.089; P<.001), demonstrating high self-efficacy (β=.043; P=.02), not living with children (β=.0340; P=.02), having a household per capita monthly income of >Y4000 (US $550) (β=.048; P=.002), experiencing high perceived social support (β=.096; P<.001), reporting a high quality of life (β=.149; P<.001), having higher levels of family communication (β=–.071; P<.001), having an identity bubble (β=.085; P<.001), not having chronic diseases (β=.049; P=.001), and experiencing mild depression (β=–.035; P=.02) were associated with older adults’ willingness to use mHealth devices. The classification and regression tree decision tree model’s findings demonstrated that the primary determinants of older adults’ desire to use mHealth devices are quality of life, identity bubble, social status, health literacy, family health, and perceived social support.
Conclusions
This study uses the Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model to investigate the effects of demand variables, enabling resources, and predisposing traits on older persons’ propensity to use mHealth devices. These results offer reference data for the marketing and use of mHealth devices for older individuals in the future. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to create a balanced and harmonious integration of technology and humanistic care.";https://doi.org/10.2196/66804;"older adults; mobile health devices; health management; medical services; mobile phone";Journal of Medical Internet Research;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438887125003048;ScienceDirect;analysis of factors influencing the willingness of chinese older adults to use mhealth devices: nationwide cross-sectional survey study

Jared Reid and Matthew McCrosson and Jacqueline Tobin and Gabriella Rivas and Stacey Rothwell and Langdon Hartsock and Kristoff Reid;Opportunistic CT screening demonstrates increased risk for peri-articular fractures in osteoporotic patients;2024;110;8;103935;Desconocido;"Background
Underdiagnosis or undertreatment of osteoporosis consequently impacts individual morbidity and mortality, as well as on healthcare systems and communities as a whole. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard method for identifying osteoporosis, however, opportunistic CT screening is capable of precisely estimating bone mineral density (BMD) in abdominopelvic imaging with no additional cost, radiation exposure or inconvenience to patients. This study uses opportunistic CT screening to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis and anatomic distribution patterns in patients presenting with lower extremity fractures at our institution.
Hypothesis
Trauma patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) are more likely to present with peri-articular versus shaft fractures.
Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective review of 721 patients presenting as trauma activations to the emergency department (ED) of a Level 1 Trauma Center with lower extremity fractures. Patients were excluded if under the age of 18 or lacking a CT scan upon arrival in the ED. Hounsfield Units (HU) were measured at the L1 vertebral level on CT scans to determine bone mineral density. Values of ≤100 HU were consistent with osteoporosis, whereas 101–150 HU were consistent with osteopenia.
Results
The final cohort included 416 patients, with mean age of 49 ± 21 years. Average bone density was 203.9 ± 73.4 HU. 15.9% of patients were diagnosed as osteopenic and 9.9% as osteoporotic. 64.2% of fractures were peri-articular, 25.7% were shaft, and 10.1% were a combination. Peri-articular fractures were significantly more likely to have lower average BMD than shaft fractures (189 ± 74.7 HU vs. 230.6 ± 66.1 HU, p < 0.001).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates a significant relationship between low bone mineral density and lower extremity fracture pattern, however, likely influenced by other factors such as sex. Opportunistic CT screening for osteoporosis in trauma settings provides ample opportunity for early detection of low BMD and implementation of highly effective lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy intervention. Reduction in the overall incidence of peri-articular fracture with widespread adoption of opportunistic CT screening may lessen the morbidity, mortality, and total cost currently afflicting patients, healthcare systems, and communities.

Aimery Sabelle and Julien Berhouet and Adrien Lemaignen and Louis-Romée {Le Nail} and Ramy Samargandi;Results of the Girdlestone Procedure for the Treatment of Refractory Hip Prosthesis Infections;2025;Desconocido;Desconocido;104313;Desconocido;"Introduction
Refractory prosthetic joint infections (PJI) of the hip remain a major challenge in orthopedic surgery. The Girdlestone procedure, also known as resection arthroplasty, was originally described for native hips but has since been adopted as a salvage option for complex and recurrent prosthetic infections. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in treating prosthetic hip infections in this context.
Materials and methods
Eighty-eight patients (91 hips) who underwent femoral resection arthroplasty for refractory hip prosthesis infection between March 2004 and August 2019 were retrospectively included and analyzed as part of a single-center study with a minimum follow-up of two years. The primary outcome was infection eradication. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of treatment failure and the nature of postoperative complications. Risk factors for failure were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. Bacteriological data and functional outcomes were also reported.
Results
Out of 91 hips, infection eradication was achieved in 65 cases (71%) following Girdlestone procedure. Six postoperative deaths related to infection occurred (6/88, 7%). In 20 out of 91 hips (22%), one or more revision surgeries were performed for persistent infection after implant removal. Among these, infection control was achieved in 10/20 (50%). Multivariate analysis identified corticosteroid use (HR = 6; p < 0.01), preoperative fever (HR = 4.12; p < 0.01), and polymicrobial infection (HR = 2.5; p < 0.05) as independent risk factors for failure. The mean limb shortening was 5.7 (±1.7) cm, and the average walking distance was 175 (±350) meters. The mean Merle d’Aubigné and Postel score at final follow-up was 9.3 (±2.2) out of 18.
Conclusion
Definitive removal of the hip prosthesis remains a viable therapeutic option in refractory infections, despite a substantial complication rate. It should be considered, particularly when the prosthesis is no longer functional.

In technological advancement, fostering students’ creativity is particularly crucial. This study examines how creative growth mindsets, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) self-efficacy, creative environments, ICT availability, and ICT information practices influence creative self-efficacy (CSE) and creative thinking. The study conducted path analyses on 16,148 secondary school students in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, China in PISA 2022. The results showed that growth mindsets, ICT self-efficacy, and creative environments can directly promote their creative self-efficacy and thinking, while school environments negatively impact creative thinking. Besides, online information practices mediate the relationship between predictors, CSE, and creative thinking. However, ICT feedback and support do not serve as mediators for creative thinking. ICT availability at school positively affects CSE through ICT feedback, while ICT availability outside of school has a negative effect. This study highlights the combined influence of individual traits, behaviors, and external environments on students’ creative thinking, providing valuable insights for educators to take a holistic approach to fostering student development.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2025.102631;"Creative thinking; Creative self-efficacy; Creative environments; ICT self-efficacy; ICT information practices; PISA 2022";International Journal of Educational Research;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035525001053;ScienceDirect;the role of growth mindset, self-efficacy, and environmental support in ict practices for creative thinking development
Robert Birch and Jordan Miller and Jeffrey Surina and Gregory Daubs and Aaron Gray and Karen E. Nelson and Brock Wentz and Erik N. Kubiak;Rate of skin and nerve complications as a result of cutaneous traction with modern foam boots;2024;55;8;111687;Desconocido;"Introduction
Cutaneous traction is used to temporize lower extremity fractures and relies on friction between the skin and surrounding material to apply a longitudinal force. This circumferential compressive force can lead to pressure sores, skin sloughing, or compressive neuropathies. These complications have been reported in up to 11% of patients when the cutaneous traction relies on adhesive tapes, plaster, and rubber bandages being in immediate contact with the skin. The rates of these complications are not well documented when using modern foam boots.
Methods
A retrospective chart review was performed on all orthopedic trauma patients who suffered pelvic or lower extremity injuries between March 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2021 at a single Level-1 trauma center. We included all patients with femoral fractures, axially unstable pelvic ring and/or acetabular fractures, and unstable hip dislocations temporized with the use of cutaneous traction. All patients had intact skin and lower extremity nerve function prior to application.
Results
There were 138 patients identified with 141 lower extremities. The average patient age was 50.7 (6–100) years. Mean traction weight of 9.8 (5–20) pounds. Average traction duration was 20.9 (2.3–243.5) hours. At the time of traction removal, there was 1 (0.7%) new skin wound and 0 nerve palsies. The new skin wound was a stage one heel pressure sore and did not require further treatment.
Conclusion
Cutaneous traction with a modern foam boot was found to have a skin complication rate of 0.7% and a nerve palsy complication rate of 0% for an overall complication rate of 0.7%, which has not been previously established and is lower than historically reported complication rates of 11% when utilizing adhesive and plaster directly on skin.

Through two studies utilizing the Triarchic psychopathy model in undergraduate samples, significant psychopathy impairment was identified. Broadly, disinhibition was related to the most significant impairments across functioning domains. Boldness was more variable and elicited both positive (e.g., higher quality of life, lower self-harm) and negative (impairments in empathy and intimacy) outcomes. Meanness was primarily related to interpersonal difficulties; however, differences in measuring meanness led to different findings on its connection to personality functioning.

Therefore, this study aims to build a structured BHR knowledge graph based on multi-modal data, providing sufficient structured knowledge for BHR enhancement. An automated knowledge graph construction approach is proposed to empower the ontology design and triple extraction by large language models (LLMs), and validation processes based on In-context Learning (ICL) prompts. A case study is conducted to construct the knowledge graph of BHR under rainstorms in Hong Kong. The performance of the proposed LLMs-empowered knowledge extraction is also validated based on natural language processing metrics and LLMs-based Evaluation (LLMs-Eval). BHR knowledge graph indicates the potential relations between disasters, factors, response actions, and the health status of the building and occupants, and provides insight to guide the BHR enhancement.

A retrospective real-world cohort study;2025;Desconocido;Desconocido;100030;Desconocido;"Background
Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Given its rarity, clinical management often mirrors colorectal cancer dCRC), despite distinct molecular features and inferior outcomes. Although checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy has shown efficacy in mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) CRC, data in SBA remain scarce, and MMR testing is not routinely implemented.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of SBA patients treated with CPI at Copenhagen University Hospital – Herlev between March 2019 and January 2024. Radiological responses were assessed using RECIST v1.1. We also analyzed the frequency of MMR testing and dMMR status in SBA patients.
Results
Among 148 SBA patients, seven received CPI therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) was 86%, with one (14%) complete response (CR) and five (71%) partial responses (PR). Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 31 months (mFU:32 months); median overall survival (mOS) was not reached (mFU: 33 months). Overall, 55% underwent MMR testing, and 18% of SBA patients were dMMR.
Conclusion
CPI therapy yields high, durable response rates in dMMR SBA, supporting dMMR as a predictive biomarker. However, inconsistent MMR testing strategy may limit access to optimal treatment.

The purpose of our study was to develop a novel magnetic resonance imaging classification system to predict the progression of traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (TONFH) in young adults and assess its clinical implications.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2007 to December 2022, including 134 hips (134 patients, mean age 41 years (range, 21 to 43), 65.7% men) diagnosed with TONFH at Association Research Circulation Osseous Stage I. The bone repair band (BRB) classification system categorized lesions into Superficial (Type S), Uncertain (Type U), and Extensive (Type E) based on magnetic resonance imaging coronal views. Patients were followed with observational treatment and x-ray assessments. Radiographic signs and femoral head collapse were evaluated during follow-up. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between BRB classification and disease progression.
Results
The 134 hips were categorized into Type S (n = 54), Type U (n = 21), and Type E (n = 59). Over a mean follow-up of 39.6 months, radiographic signs were most prevalent in Type E (94.9%) and least in Type S (9.3%), with median times to radiographic signs of 18 months for Type U and 16 months for Type E. Femoral head collapse occurred in 50.8% of Type E, 23.8% of Type U, and none in Type S, with a median time to collapse of 34 months for Type E. Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified BRB classification as an independent predictor of disease progression, with Type E showing the highest risk for adverse outcomes.
Conclusions
The newly proposed BRB classification provides a systematic approach to assessing necrotic lesion severity in TONFH and demonstrates significant correlation with femoral head collapse risk. Future studies are needed to further validate its clinical significance and explore the anatomical basis underlying this classification.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2025.06.030;"traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head; ARCO classification; femoral head collapse; BRB classification; progression";The Journal of Arthroplasty;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883540325007090;ScienceDirect;predicting progression of traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head based on magnetic resonance imaging classification: a retrospective cohort study

Large language models (LLMs) hold potential in clinical decision-making, especially for complex and rare disease diagnoses. However, real-world applications require further evaluation for accuracy and utility.
Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of four LLMs (GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, ERNIE, and Llama-3) using real-world inpatient medical records and assess the impact of different prompt engineering methods.
Method
This single-center, retrospective study was conducted at Peking University International Hospital. It involved 1,122 medical records categorized into common rheumatic autoimmune diseases, rare rheumatic autoimmune diseases, and non-rheumatic diseases. Four LLMs were evaluated using two prompt engineering methods: few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting. Diagnostic accuracy (hit1) was defined as the inclusion of the first final diagnosis from the medical record in the model’s top prediction.
Results
Hit1 of four LLMs were as follows: GPT-4omini (81.8 %), GPT-4o (82.4 %), ERNIE (82.9 %) and Llama-3 (82.7 %). Few-shot prompting significantly improved GPT-4o’s hit1 (85.9 %) compared to its base model (p = 0.02), outperforming other models (all p < 0.05). Chain-of-thought prompting showed no significant improvement. Hit1 for both common and rare rheumatic diseases was consistently higher than that for non-rheumatic disease. Few-shot prompting increased costs per correct diagnosis for GPT-4o by approximately ¥4.54.
Conclusions
LLMs, including GPT-4o, demonstrate promising diagnostic accuracy on real medical records. Few-shot prompting enhances performance but at higher costs, underscoring the need for accuracy improvements and cost management. These findings inform LLM development in Chinese medical contexts and highlight the necessity for further multi-center validation.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.106026;"Large Language Models; LLMs; Prompt Engineering; Accuracy; Rheumatic Disease; Realworld";International Journal of Medical Informatics;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505625002436;ScienceDirect;comparing the accuracy of large language models and prompt engineering in diagnosing realworld cases

Jared Reid and Matthew McCrosson and Jacqueline Tobin and Gabriella Rivas and Stacey Rothwell and Langdon Hartsock and Kristoff Reid;Opportunistic CT screening demonstrates increased risk for peri-articular fractures in osteoporotic patients;2024;110;8;103935;Desconocido;"Background
Underdiagnosis or undertreatment of osteoporosis consequently impacts individual morbidity and mortality, as well as on healthcare systems and communities as a whole. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard method for identifying osteoporosis, however, opportunistic CT screening is capable of precisely estimating bone mineral density (BMD) in abdominopelvic imaging with no additional cost, radiation exposure or inconvenience to patients. This study uses opportunistic CT screening to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis and anatomic distribution patterns in patients presenting with lower extremity fractures at our institution.
Hypothesis
Trauma patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) are more likely to present with peri-articular versus shaft fractures.
Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective review of 721 patients presenting as trauma activations to the emergency department (ED) of a Level 1 Trauma Center with lower extremity fractures. Patients were excluded if under the age of 18 or lacking a CT scan upon arrival in the ED. Hounsfield Units (HU) were measured at the L1 vertebral level on CT scans to determine bone mineral density. Values of ≤100 HU were consistent with osteoporosis, whereas 101–150 HU were consistent with osteopenia.
Results
The final cohort included 416 patients, with mean age of 49 ± 21 years. Average bone density was 203.9 ± 73.4 HU. 15.9% of patients were diagnosed as osteopenic and 9.9% as osteoporotic. 64.2% of fractures were peri-articular, 25.7% were shaft, and 10.1% were a combination. Peri-articular fractures were significantly more likely to have lower average BMD than shaft fractures (189 ± 74.7 HU vs. 230.6 ± 66.1 HU, p < 0.001).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates a significant relationship between low bone mineral density and lower extremity fracture pattern, however, likely influenced by other factors such as sex. Opportunistic CT screening for osteoporosis in trauma settings provides ample opportunity for early detection of low BMD and implementation of highly effective lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy intervention. Reduction in the overall incidence of peri-articular fracture with widespread adoption of opportunistic CT screening may lessen the morbidity, mortality, and total cost currently afflicting patients, healthcare systems, and communities.

Robert Birch and Jordan Miller and Jeffrey Surina and Gregory Daubs and Aaron Gray and Karen E. Nelson and Brock Wentz and Erik N. Kubiak;Rate of skin and nerve complications as a result of cutaneous traction with modern foam boots;2024;55;8;111687;Desconocido;"Introduction
Cutaneous traction is used to temporize lower extremity fractures and relies on friction between the skin and surrounding material to apply a longitudinal force. This circumferential compressive force can lead to pressure sores, skin sloughing, or compressive neuropathies. These complications have been reported in up to 11% of patients when the cutaneous traction relies on adhesive tapes, plaster, and rubber bandages being in immediate contact with the skin. The rates of these complications are not well documented when using modern foam boots.
Methods
A retrospective chart review was performed on all orthopedic trauma patients who suffered pelvic or lower extremity injuries between March 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2021 at a single Level-1 trauma center. We included all patients with femoral fractures, axially unstable pelvic ring and/or acetabular fractures, and unstable hip dislocations temporized with the use of cutaneous traction. All patients had intact skin and lower extremity nerve function prior to application.
Results
There were 138 patients identified with 141 lower extremities. The average patient age was 50.7 (6–100) years. Mean traction weight of 9.8 (5–20) pounds. Average traction duration was 20.9 (2.3–243.5) hours. At the time of traction removal, there was 1 (0.7%) new skin wound and 0 nerve palsies. The new skin wound was a stage one heel pressure sore and did not require further treatment.
Conclusion
Cutaneous traction with a modern foam boot was found to have a skin complication rate of 0.7% and a nerve palsy complication rate of 0% for an overall complication rate of 0.7%, which has not been previously established and is lower than historically reported complication rates of 11% when utilizing adhesive and plaster directly on skin.

Zhilong Cai and Shuoyu Rui and Jianhua Chen and Nanqu Huang and Yong Luo and Fei Feng;Association between diabetes status and falls: a 9-year prospective cohort study using the China health and retirement longitudinal study;2025;19-20;Desconocido;100282;Desconocido;"Background
Falls represent a significant health burden among individuals with diabetes, yet the long-term relationship between diabetes status and fall risk remains inadequately characterized in Asian populations. This study aimed to investigate the association between diabetes status and incident falls among Chinese middle-aged and older adults using nationally representative longitudinal data.
Methods
Utilizing China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011–2020 data, we included 9553 participants (aged ≥45 years) for a 9-year prospective cohort study. Diabetes was classified as normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or diabetes based on self-reported diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), or HbA1c levels. Incident falls were assessed via self-reports across four survey waves from 2011 to 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were to evaluate the independent association between diabetes and falls and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Results
The study included 7131 (74.6 %) participants with normal glucose levels, 1254 (13.1 %) with prediabetes, and 1168 (12.2 %) with diabetes. Mean age was 58.1 ± 9.0 years, with 46.9 % males. Fall incidence rates were significantly higher in the diabetes group (55.1 %) compared to prediabetes (48.3 %) and normal glucose groups (47.3 %) (P < 0.001). After full adjustment for potential confounders, diabetes was associated with a 27 % increased risk of incident falls (OR=1.27, 95 % CI: 1.11–1.45, P < 0.001), while prediabetes showed no significant association (OR=0.99, 95 % CI: 0.87–1.12, P = 0.817). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations in older adults aged ≥60 years (OR=1.45, 95 % CI: 1.18–1.78) compared to those <60 years (OR=1.17, 95 % CI: 0.98–1.39), with similar effects in both sexes. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.
Conclusions
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of incident falls among Chinese middle-aged and older adults, with a 27 % higher risk persisting after comprehensive adjustment. This association appears to be specific to established diabetes rather than prediabetes, suggesting a pathophysiological threshold effect. The findings support the integration of fall prevention strategies into routine diabetes care, particularly for older adults, and have important implications for clinical practice guidelines and public health policy in China's rapidly aging population.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.deman.2025.100282;"Diabetes; Falls; Aging; Cohort study; CHARLS";Diabetes Epidemiology and Management;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666970625000307;ScienceDirect;association between diabetes status and falls: a 9-year prospective cohort study using the china health and retirement longitudinal study

Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV & Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability.

Large language models (LLMs) hold potential in clinical decision-making, especially for complex and rare disease diagnoses. However, real-world applications require further evaluation for accuracy and utility.
Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of four LLMs (GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, ERNIE, and Llama-3) using real-world inpatient medical records and assess the impact of different prompt engineering methods.
Method
This single-center, retrospective study was conducted at Peking University International Hospital. It involved 1,122 medical records categorized into common rheumatic autoimmune diseases, rare rheumatic autoimmune diseases, and non-rheumatic diseases. Four LLMs were evaluated using two prompt engineering methods: few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting. Diagnostic accuracy (hit1) was defined as the inclusion of the first final diagnosis from the medical record in the model’s top prediction.
Results
Hit1 of four LLMs were as follows: GPT-4omini (81.8 %), GPT-4o (82.4 %), ERNIE (82.9 %) and Llama-3 (82.7 %). Few-shot prompting significantly improved GPT-4o’s hit1 (85.9 %) compared to its base model (p = 0.02), outperforming other models (all p < 0.05). Chain-of-thought prompting showed no significant improvement. Hit1 for both common and rare rheumatic diseases was consistently higher than that for non-rheumatic disease. Few-shot prompting increased costs per correct diagnosis for GPT-4o by approximately ¥4.54.
Conclusions
LLMs, including GPT-4o, demonstrate promising diagnostic accuracy on real medical records. Few-shot prompting enhances performance but at higher costs, underscoring the need for accuracy improvements and cost management.

Grigorii Khvatskii and Yong Suk Lee and Corey Angst and Maria Gibbs and Robert Landers and Nitesh V. Chawla;Do multimodal large language models understand welding?;2025;120;Desconocido;103121;Desconocido;This paper examines the performance of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in skilled production work, with a focus on welding. Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV & Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability. The study opens avenues for further research into multimodal learning in industry applications.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103121;"AI in manufacturing; Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs); Welding; Skilled production work; Real-world image classification; WeldPrompt";Information Fusion;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253525001940;ScienceDirect;do multimodal large language models understand welding?
Andrea Dell’Olio and Franco Biasioli and Vincenzo Fogliano and Josep Rubert;Decoding microbial volatile signals in host–microbiome crosstalk;2025;Desconocido;Desconocido;Desconocido;Desconocido;The human gut microbiome is a complex microbial ecosystem which has a profound impact on host health and disease. The research focus in this area is rapidly moving from taxonomy to functionality, elucidating the biological role of small molecules produced by the gut microbiome in regulating host metabolism. Among these, microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) play several roles in bacterial communication and microbe–host signaling. Volatilomics, the comprehensive study of volatile metabolites, is emerging as a powerful tool for discovering and investigating these interactions. In this review we examine the current understanding of mVOCs in the gut and highlight how dedicated in vitro and ex vivo volatilomics experiments, alongside in vivo studies, can uncover the biological roles for these emerging small molecules.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2025.08.004;"microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs); volatilomics; intestinal health; host–microbe communication";Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276025001730;ScienceDirect;decoding microbial volatile signals in host–microbiome crosstalk
Heiner Fangerau;Artifical intelligence in surgery: ethical considerations in the light of social trends in the perception of health and medicine;2024;9;5;323;328;The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine and surgery is currently predicted to be very promising.However, AI has the potential to change the doctor’s role and the doctor–patient relationship. It has the potential to support people’s desires for health, along with the potential to nudge or push people to behave in a certain way.To understand these potentials, we must see AI in the light of social developments that have brought about changes in how medicine’s role, in a given society, is understood.The trends of ‘privatisation of medicine’ and ‘public-healthisation of the private’ are proposed as a contextual backdrop to explain why AI raises ethical concerns different from those previously caused by new medical technologies, and which therefore need to be addressed specifically for AI.;https://doi.org/10.1530/EOR-24-0029;"artificial intelligence; surgery; ethics; social developments; medical concepts; privatisation; public health; history; future";EFORT Open Reviews;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058524124000495;ScienceDirect;artifical intelligence in surgery: ethical considerations in the light of social trends in the perception of health and medicine

Al-Tawfiq and Mohamad-Hani Temsah;Healthcare workers’ knowledge and preparedness for unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak in Saudi Arabia;2024;17;12;102584;Desconocido;"Background
The recent unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak in Saudi Arabia necessitated an assessment of healthcare workers' (HCWs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). This study assessed healthcare workers' knowledge regarding the transmission, contagiousness, presentation, and diagnosis of foodborne botulism, as well as their management practices, including contacting public health authorities, administering antitoxin, preparedness to respond to botulism cases and consulting generative Artificial Intelligent (AI)-chatbots, like ChatGPT.
Methods
A cross-sectional online survey targeting Saudi HCWs was conducted from May 6–19, 2024, following the first foodborne botulism outbreak. The survey, developed by infectious disease and public health experts according to the Saudi Public Health Authority (SPHA) botulism guidelines, covered several sections: demographics, knowledge about foodborne botulism, attitudes and perceptions, intended practices, and worry level. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, multivariable linear regression to assess factors influencing knowledge, and multivariable logistic binary regression to evaluate factors affecting confidence in handling botulism.
Results
Among the 1058 participants, the knowledge score was 9.69/20 (48.4 % correct ± 18 %), with higher scores among HCWs working in tertiary centers, older than 34 years, reading SPHA botulism protocol, and using scientific journals as main information sources. HCWs consulting ChatGPT had significantly lower knowledge scores (p-value < 0.001). HCWs displayed highly intended practices in managing botulism, with a mean score of 4.10/5. The self-rated management confidence was moderate (2.84 ± 1.05 out of 5-points). Multivariable logistic binary regression showed that previous experience with botulism and reading SPHA protocol were the most significant factors associated with a higher management confidence.
Conclusions
This study highlights significant HCWs’ knowledge gaps during unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak. Previous experience with botulism cases and reading recent guidelines were associated with higher knowledge and confidence, while reliance on ChatGPT was linked to lower scores. This study emphasizes the importance of timely publishing local guidelines to favorably affect both knowledge and confidence to deal with infectious outbreaks.

Haitao Tao and Yining Liu and Lijie Wang and Jinliang Wang and Junxun Ma and Guoqing Zhang and Zhefeng Liu and Yi Hu;Safety and efficacy of Cisplatin in combination with Sintilimab and Niraparib in patients with advanced solid tumors: a phase Ib study;2025;Desconocido;Desconocido;Desconocido;Desconocido;"Background
Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy can enhance anti-tumor activity. This phase Ib clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin in combination with sintilimab and niraparib in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Methods
Patients with advanced solid tumors who had progressed after first-line or more lines of standard therapy were enrolled in the study, and received cisplatin and sintilimab on day 1 and niraparib from days 1–21 every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with sintilimab and niraparib (the same doses and schedules as before), until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicities. During the dose-escalation phase, patients were divided into three dose groups on the basis of a 3+3 dose-escalation regimen, and a dose-expansion phase was conducted based on the determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The primary endpoint was safety, including treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the secondary endpoint was efficacy. In addition, exploratory endpoints were prespecified to analyze potential biomarkers.
Results
From July 31, 2019, to July 1, 2022, a total of 26 patients were enrolled, and no DLTs were observed in the dose-escalation phase. The recommended RP2Ds of cisplatin, sintilimab, and niraparib were 60 mg/m2, 200 mg, and 100 mg every 3 weeks, respectively. All of the patients experienced varying degrees of TRAEs, and a 19.23% (5 patients) incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). With the median follow-up time of 47.9 months (95% CI: 38.8–NA), objective response rate was 26.92% (7 patients, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.57–47.79), disease control rate was 57.69% (15patients, 95% CI, 36.92–76.65), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.30 months (95% CI, 2.14–4.46) and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.03 months (95% CI, 3.41–12.66), with PFS rates of 26.92% (seven patients) and 11.54% (three patients) at 6 and 12 months, and OS rates of 69.23%, 34.62% and 11.54% at 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Patients with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥1% showed significantly longer PFS (3.93 months, P = 0.032) and OS (14.97 months, P = 0.036) compared to those with PD-L1 expression <1%.
Conclusion
The combination of cisplatin with sintilimab and niraparib showed a manageable safety profile and modest anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Further validation in larger, histology-specific patients is needed to confirm clinical benefit.

Population-based penetrance studies of breast cancer gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in the Eastern Chinese population are currently lacking; thus, we aimed to investigate the penetrance of breast cancer and other malignant tumors among BRCA1/2 P/LP variant carriers using a population-based breast cancer cohort from communities in Eastern China.
Methods
Between July 2019 and March 2021, we tested 2216 breast cancer probands from Chinese communities for BRCA1/2 mutations and collected detailed information on the age, survival status, and malignancy history of first-degree relatives. The kin-cohort method was used to calculate the penetrance of breast cancer and other malignant tumors.
Results
Of the 2216 breast cancer probands, 109 (4.90%) carried BRCA1/2 P/LP variants, 49 in the BRCA1 gene and 60 in the BRCA2 gene. The penetrance of female breast cancer by 85 years of age was 22.50% and 18.20% in BRCA1 and BRCA2 P/LP variant carriers, respectively. The penetrance of ovarian cancer by 85 years of age was 26.00% in BRCA1 P/LP variant carriers. The penetrance of other malignancies did not reach statistical significance owing to the small number of events.
Conclusions
Our findings showed that breast cancer penetrance among BRCA1 and BRCA2 P/LP variant carriers was 22.50% and 18.20%, respectively, which suggests that prophylactic mastectomy may not be necessary for such Chinese individuals.

Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) are a treatment option for patients with advanced high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian carcinoma (OC). Recent guidelines have clarified how homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may influence treatment decision-making in this setting. As a result, numerous companion diagnostic assays (CDx) have been developed to identify HRD. However, the optimal HRD testing strategy is an area of debate. Moreover, recently published clinical and translational data may impact how HRD status may be used to identify patients likely to benefit from PARPi use. We aimed to extensively compare available HRD CDx and establish a worldwide expert consensus on HRD testing in primary and recurrent OC.
Methods
A group of 99 global experts from 31 different countries was formed. Using a modified Delphi process, the experts aimed to establish consensus statements based on a systematic literature search and CDx information sought from investigators, companies and/or publications.
Results
Technical information, including analytical and clinical validation, were obtained from 14 of 15 available HRD CDx (7 academic; 7 commercial). Consensus was reached on 36 statements encompassing the following topics: 1) the predictive impact of HRD status on PARPi use in primary and recurrent OC; 2) analytical and clinical validation requirements of HRD CDx; 3) resource-stratified HRD testing; and 4) how future CDx may include additional approaches to help address unmet testing needs.

Extracellular traps (ETs) are an immune cell effector function first described in neutrophils wherein chromatin is decondensed, decorated with cytotoxic granule enzymes, and expelled from the cell body. Recently, ETs have been linked to poor functional outcomes in SCI; however, translatable agents to prevent ET-mediated damage after SCI have yet to be explored. We assessed recombinant human (rh) DNase (trade name Pulmozyme) as a potential therapeutic that could be repurposed to break down ETs after SCI. To determine the timing of treatment, we characterized the timeline of ET formation in a thoracic contusion model of SCI in mice. We found that ETs levels increased in the injured spinal cord by 4 h post injury (hpi), peaking within 24 hpi. When rhDNase was administered at 1 hpi, DNase activity in the serum remained elevated for 24 hpi with a corresponding increase in circulating ET fragments. At 6 hpi, blood-spinal cord barrier permeability was attenuated in rhDNase-treated animals. Long-term functional hind limb recovery, as assessed by the ladder rung walking test, was improved at 35 dpi in rhDNase-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated controls. RhDNase-treated animals also exhibited shorter SCI lesion lengths at 35 dpi. Altogether, our data demonstrate the potential of rhDNase as an anti-ET therapeutic to improve long-term SCI outcomes.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2025.04.033;"Spinal Cord Injury; Neurotrauma; Neuroinflammation; Innate Immunity; Neutrophils; Neutrophil Extracellular Traps; DNases; Functional Motor Recovery";Brain, Behavior, and Immunity;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159125001692;ScienceDirect;recombinant human dnase treatment mitigates extracellular trap mediated damage and improves long-term recovery after spinal cord injury in male mice

Xukai Zhang and Nan Zhang and Jingyuan Lin and Wuji Lin and Zongling He and Hong Li;Neural and behavioral signatures of feedback-based adjustment bias in response to infant cries;2025;218;Desconocido;109253;Desconocido;"Infant crying is a critical signal that prompts caregiving, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying how individuals adapt to feedback in this context are underexplored. Here, in 34 young adults (18 female; age from 19 to 26 years) with no prior caregiving experience, we used an infant cry feedback paradigm to characterize individual differences in behavioral adjustment and their neural correlates. Participants judged the cause of infant cries while their reaction time changes (ΔRT) and EEG were recorded. Our results revealed context-specific adjustment biases unique to infant cries, distinct from responses to animal vocalizations. Within the infant crying context, a negative-feedback bias (slowing after negative feedback) correlated with higher self-reported caregiving sensitivity, whereas a positive-feedback bias (slowing after positive feedback) correlated with lower caregiving motivation. Inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA) further revealed a key asymmetry in neural responses, showing that higher negative-feedback bias was associated with greater inter-subject neural similarity during negative feedback (480–1000 ms) and positive feedback (600–700 ms), whereas higher positive-feedback bias was associated with more idiosyncratic neural patterns. Furthermore, a mediation analysis showed that the influence of the Late Positive Potential (LPP) on caregiving sensitivity was fully mediated by these behavioral adjustments, where lower LPP amplitudes predicted greater slowing after negative feedback, which in turn predicted higher intended infant caregiving sensitivity. These findings link specific behavioral adjustments to an asymmetric neural similarity structure, offering potential markers for caregiving dispositions and highlighting the importance of feedback processing in caregiver-infant interactions.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2025.109253;"Infant cry; Adjustment bias; Feedback processing; EEG; Caregiving response";Neuropsychologia;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393225001885;ScienceDirect;neural and behavioral signatures of feedback-based adjustment bias in response to infant cries

This research aims to contribute to the knowledge related to youth’s media and information literacy (MIL) practices when encountering artificial intelligence (AI)-generated media in their everyday life. It specifically examines young people’s engagement with and understanding of deepfakes, seeking to explore their practices for navigating deepfakes in a daily setting.
Design/methodology/approach
Employing a qualitative research strategy, in-depth interviews were conducted to collect empirical material from 20 young participants aged 14–15 years. The empirical data were coded both inductively and deductively, leading to the identification of young people’s doings and sayings as they encounter, respond to and understand deepfakes.
Findings
The findings highlight the young participants’ serendipitous exposure to, and subsequent engagement with, deepfake content in their everyday lives, particularly through the situations, platforms and types of content in which these encounters occurred. While interaction with deepfake content was mostly characterized as casual, there are also more active responses to encountering deepfakes. Additionally, the results shed light on the participants’ understandings of deepfakes, particularly in terms of content creation, societal impact and underlying AI techniques. This understanding is proposed as a critical sub-element within the MIL framework in this study.

Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) are a treatment option for patients with advanced high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian carcinoma (OC). Recent guidelines have clarified how homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may influence treatment decision-making in this setting. As a result, numerous companion diagnostic assays (CDx) have been developed to identify HRD. However, the optimal HRD testing strategy is an area of debate. Moreover, recently published clinical and translational data may impact how HRD status may be used to identify patients likely to benefit from PARPi use. We aimed to extensively compare available HRD CDx and establish a worldwide expert consensus on HRD testing in primary and recurrent OC.
Methods
A group of 99 global experts from 31 different countries was formed. Using a modified Delphi process, the experts aimed to establish consensus statements based on a systematic literature search and CDx information sought from investigators, companies and/or publications.
Results
Technical information, including analytical and clinical validation, were obtained from 14 of 15 available HRD CDx (7 academic; 7 commercial). Consensus was reached on 36 statements encompassing the following topics: 1) the predictive impact of HRD status on PARPi use in primary and recurrent OC; 2) analytical and clinical validation requirements of HRD CDx; 3) resource-stratified HRD testing; and 4) how future CDx may include additional approaches to help address unmet testing needs.
Conclusion
This manuscript provides detailed information on currently available HRD CDx and up-to-date guidance from global experts on HRD testing in patients with primary and recurrent OC.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2024.115169;"BRCA; Companion diagnostic assays; Genomic instability; Homologous recombination deficiency; Ovarian cancer; PARP inhibitor";European Journal of Cancer;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804924017763;ScienceDirect;homologous recombination deficiency in ovarian cancer: global expert consensus on testing and a comparison of companion diagnostics

Extracellular traps (ETs) are an immune cell effector function first described in neutrophils wherein chromatin is decondensed, decorated with cytotoxic granule enzymes, and expelled from the cell body. Recently, ETs have been linked to poor functional outcomes in SCI; however, translatable agents to prevent ET-mediated damage after SCI have yet to be explored. We assessed recombinant human (rh) DNase (trade name Pulmozyme) as a potential therapeutic that could be repurposed to break down ETs after SCI. To determine the timing of treatment, we characterized the timeline of ET formation in a thoracic contusion model of SCI in mice. We found that ETs levels increased in the injured spinal cord by 4 h post injury (hpi), peaking within 24 hpi. When rhDNase was administered at 1 hpi, DNase activity in the serum remained elevated for 24 hpi with a corresponding increase in circulating ET fragments. At 6 hpi, blood-spinal cord barrier permeability was attenuated in rhDNase-treated animals. Long-term functional hind limb recovery, as assessed by the ladder rung walking test, was improved at 35 dpi in rhDNase-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated controls. RhDNase-treated animals also exhibited shorter SCI lesion lengths at 35 dpi. Altogether, our data demonstrate the potential of rhDNase as an anti-ET therapeutic to improve long-term SCI outcomes.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2025.04.033;"Spinal Cord Injury; Neurotrauma; Neuroinflammation; Innate Immunity; Neutrophils; Neutrophil Extracellular Traps; DNases; Functional Motor Recovery";Brain, Behavior, and Immunity;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159125001692;ScienceDirect;recombinant human dnase treatment mitigates extracellular trap mediated damage and improves long-term recovery after spinal cord injury in male mice

In this study, we focused on the functional characterization of durian methionine γ-lyase (DzMGL), the key enzyme in volatile sulfur compound (VSC) production. In addition, to gain a better insight into sulfur metabolism, we profiled metabolites related to this process using various methods and assessed the expression of relevant genes through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Our gene and metabolite analyses revealed that sulfur metabolism is activated during ripening. Interestingly, DzMGL exhibited a higher efficiency in using L-cysteine than Arabidopsis MGL. The differential levels of the produced VSCs explained the aroma intensity-related differences between the two commercial Thai cultivars ‘Chanee’ and ‘Monthong’. Furthermore, the cysteine availability-related differences between the two cultivars could contribute to this variation, with ‘Chanee’ containing higher cysteine levels than ‘Monthong’. Our findings indicated that γ-glutamylcysteine was the preferred form of sulfur storage in durian pulps, with a potential recycling process providing intermediates that flux methionine toward ethylene biosynthesis and VSC production.

Existing monitoring solutions are expensive and lack scalability, primarily relying on detecting angle variations beyond predefined thresholds. We developed a digital twin of a low-cost test rig for measuring belt rotation using 3D prototyping, infrared distance sensors, and a 3-axis accelerometer. We implemented a controller-responder industrial Internet of Things network using ESP-NOW protocol. Applying a minimum viable prompt, we fine-tuned an autoregressive language model for predicting the overlap position. We then developed a software application for cloud computing and local storage of measurements. Additionally, we developed a human–machine interface for future real-case applications. The bias and precision for the predicted angle (0.2294° ± 11.8822°), angular speed (0.1630 ± 0.7344 RPM), number of laps (0.0001336 ± 0.0448 laps), diameter (–0.1984 ± 6.3743 mm), and outer-edge side (100 % agreement) were suitable for the intended use.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2024.114546;"Belt rotation; Digital twin; industrial Internet of Things; Autoregressive language model";Measurement;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224124004317;ScienceDirect;belt rotation in pipe conveyors: development of an overlap monitoring system using digital twins, industrial internet of things, and autoregressive language models

However, our understanding of sulfur metabolism in fruit remains limited. In this study, we focused on the functional characterization of durian methionine γ-lyase (DzMGL), the key enzyme in volatile sulfur compound (VSC) production. In addition, to gain a better insight into sulfur metabolism, we profiled metabolites related to this process using various methods and assessed the expression of relevant genes through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Our gene and metabolite analyses revealed that sulfur metabolism is activated during ripening. Interestingly, DzMGL exhibited a higher efficiency in using L-cysteine than Arabidopsis MGL. The differential levels of the produced VSCs explained the aroma intensity-related differences between the two commercial Thai cultivars ‘Chanee’ and ‘Monthong’. Furthermore, the cysteine availability-related differences between the two cultivars could contribute to this variation, with ‘Chanee’ containing higher cysteine levels than ‘Monthong’. Our findings indicated that γ-glutamylcysteine was the preferred form of sulfur storage in durian pulps, with a potential recycling process providing intermediates that flux methionine toward ethylene biosynthesis and VSC production. This study provides novel insights into sulfur metabolism in durian fruit.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2023.112533;"Durian;  L.; Fruit ripening; γ- glutamylcysteine; Methionine γ-lyase; Sulfur metabolism";Postharvest Biology and Technology;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925521423002946;ScienceDirect;sulfur metabolism in durian pulps: factors contributing to the production of volatile sulfur compounds during fruit ripening
